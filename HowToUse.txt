You will need to import keyboard, pyautogui and OpenCV (opencv-python) libraries - pip install [package_name] (in pycharm - install packages).
First it will ask you to enter a string, these are the letters in Words On Stream game, then it will automatically focus on twitch chat (if it can be seen on screen) and
start typing these generated words. You can skip this by pressing enter.
If you notice a "Fake" letter, just simply press the letter on your keyboard and the programm will remove words containing this letter.
